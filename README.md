# Rigid-Body-Simulation

This repository is a implementation of falling body and its rebound.

As a mathematical model was used [this article](https://graphics.pixar.com/pbm2001/pdf/notesg.pdf)(Rigid Body Simulation by David Baraff).

There are no impact losses in this model, but you can easily add them by multiplying by the required coefficients.

Also you can see [how it works](https://youtu.be/F3rqg8Jy_I4)
